                <p>Hello! I'm a CS/East Asian Studies major at UChicago interested in utilizing design & technology 
                    to create well-balanced, efficient products to empower the larger community.</p>

                            I've dabbled in many kinds of design, but product design has been the most rewarding by far.
                            Understanding user painpoints and designing around their needs has become my passion — 
                            working with Long Game Savings, I reworked the onboarding tour to drive up retention of new 
                            users during the long sign-up process. 
                        </td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>
                            I love thinking about how to build technology that addresses different needs — through Uncommon
                            Hacks, my team and I created a web-based, gameified platform to address financial literacy in 
                            university-aged students. Summer of 2020, I took on a SWE internship at LucyLabs CryptoFinance,
                            working on a backend program that retrieved data from 4+ exchanges.

                        <td></td>
                        <td>
                            I believe that tech has the capability to uplift everyone — as a part of compileHer, I organized
                            and volunteered in multiple events throughout the year to teach middle school girls in the community
                            how to code at no cost. Tech can and should be accessible to everyone, especially as CS education 
                            becomes increasingly critical to having successful and enriching lives.
